# R & D - Prices and Volumes Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing stock prices and trading volumes using Python. The analysis is performed using Jupyter Notebooks, providing a comprehensive approach to examining financial data. The project can be used to extract insights from stock market trends by processing and visualizing price and volume data.

## Project Overview

This repository contains Python code for:

- Reading stock prices and trading volume data from CSV files
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data
- Calculating statistical summaries (e.g., moving averages, returns, etc.)
- Visualizing stock price movements and trading volume trends

## Installation

To run the notebook, follow these steps:

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stefanciprian/rd.git
```

### Install the required dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook prices_and_volumes.ipynb
```

## Files

- **prices_and_volumes.ipynb**: The main notebook file containing code for analyzing stock prices and volumes.

## Features

- **Load Data**: Load historical stock data from CSV/yfinance.
- **ARIMA**: Implement AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average for time series forecasting.
- **Bayesian**: Apply Bayesian methods for statistical analysis.
- **Fractional Gaussian Noise (fGn)**: Analyze data with fractional Gaussian noise characteristics.
- **Fractional Lévy Stable Motion (FLSM)**: Model data using fractional Lévy stable motion.
- **Higuchi Fractal Dimension**: Calculate the Higuchi fractal dimension for time series.
- **Hurst Exponent**: Estimate the Hurst exponent to assess long-term memory of time series.
- **Linear Regression**: Perform linear regression analysis on stock data.
- **Lorenz System**: Analyze the Lorenz system for chaotic behavior.
- **Markov**: Implement Markov models for predictive analysis.
- **Pearson**: Calculate Pearson correlation coefficients for data relationships.
- **Random Forest**: Use random forest algorithms for classification and regression tasks.

## How to Use

After loading your stock data, the notebook will guide you through various analytical steps such as calculating statistics, applying technical indicators, and visualizing results.
